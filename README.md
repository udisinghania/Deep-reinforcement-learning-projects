Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Projects

Projects' code was most part of from the Udacity's [deep-reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning) repository. After making some changes in the code, we implement the projects.

1. [Project 1: Navigation](https://github.com/udisinghania/Deep-reinforcement-learning-projects/tree/master/P1_Navigation)

2. [Project 2: Continuous Control](https://github.com/udisinghania/Deep-reinforcement-learning-projects/tree/master/P2_Continuous%20Control)

3. [Project 3: Collaborate and Compete](https://github.com/udisinghania/Deep-reinforcement-learning-projects/tree/master/P1_Navigation)
